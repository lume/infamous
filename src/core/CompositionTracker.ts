// can fully contain the composition tracking.

// TODO After the above, move this class along with ChildTracker to
// `@lume/element` or somewhere as generic custom element utilities. Sub-classes
// should filter out specific undesired elements while CompositionTracker is generic.

// TODO a more generic v2 implementation: a node shuold be able to observe when
// it is composed into any element, no matter if the element is custom or not.
// Currently, we rely on the composed parent and children both extending from
// CompositionTracker for composition tracking to work, but if an element gets
// composed into some other element like a regular `<div>`, composition is not
// tracked.
// What we need to approximately do is have a CompositionTracker instance detect
// its regular parentElement in `connectedCallback` no matter what element it
// is, observe if it has a `ShadowRoot` by patching global `attachShadow` (with
// the limitation that the code has to be imported before any roots are
// attached) so that we can react to the presence of a ShadowRoot now or in the
// future, then we should enact similar logic as in this class in the
// arbitrary parent element's ShadowRoot.
