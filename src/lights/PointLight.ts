 *
 * An element that illuminates objects near it, casting shadows in any direction
 * away from the light by default. The light element itself is not visible; to
 * visualize it you can place a sphere as a child of the light for example.
 *
 * The light's shadow projection camera is a PerspectiveCamera with fov of 90,
 * with aspect of 1.
 *
 * All mesh elements [receive](../meshes/Mesh#receiveshadow) or
 * [cast](../meshes/Mesh#castshadow) shadows by default.
 *
