     * When a render tasks is added a new requestAnimationFrame loop will be

     *
     * A render task is simply a function that will be called over and over
     * again, in the Motor's animation loop. That's all, nothing special.
     * However, if a Element3D setter is used inside of a render task, then the Element3D
     * will tell Motor that it needs to be re-rendered, which will happen at
     * the end of the current frame. If a Element3D setter is used outside of a
     * render task (i.e. outside of the Motor's animation loop), then the Element3D
     * tells Motor to re-render the Element3D on the next animation loop tick.
     * Basically, regardless of where the Element3D's setters are used (inside or
     * outside of the Motor's animation loop), rendering always happens inside
     * the loop.
     *
     * @param {Function} fn The render task to add.

     * @return {Function} A reference to the render task. Useful for saving to
     * a variable so that it can later be passed to Motor.removeRenderTask().
